            Rodić Davidson: London Architecture
          </h1>
          <p class="rda-main__right__article__text">
            Our Bloomsbury based practice has been working in central London
            since 2006. Having worked within the oldest areas of London, we have
            developed an expertise in historic buildings. These are often Listed
            and situated within a Conservation Area. Our knowledge and
            experience consistently secure Planning Consents, Listed Building
            Consents and Great Estate Licenses.
          </p>
          <p class="rda-main__right__article__text">
            Many areas within central London boroughs were originally developed
            by aristocratic families (examples being Grosvenor, Cadogan, De
            Walden, Portman and Bedford), and these family estates still own
            large swathes of, what is now commonly referred to as, Prime Central
            London. These Great Estates maintain significant influence either
            through direct ownership or through various stewardship schemes, an
            example being the Belgrave Estate Management Scheme administered by
            Grosvenor. Schemes such as this enable the Estate to exert control
            over the use, development, and appearance of the designated area.
          </p>
          <p class="rda-main__right__article__text">
            We have a growing body of new-build work in Prime Central London and
            elsewhere the UK. Through sensitive, contextual design and iterative
            dialogue with Clients and Planners, Rodić Davidson have established
            a track record of obtaining difficult planning consents for both
            new-build and existing properties.
